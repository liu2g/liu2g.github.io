The work presented is the preliminary stage of my Master's thesis on autonomous collaborative robots (cobots).

In particular, we investigated a cooperative object transportation method using a group of autonomous networked cobots (collaborative robots).
Using two KUKA YouBot and CoppeliaSim simulation software, we validated our work in a simulated environment.

Our work was documented in a conference paper, which is accepted and in proceeding for [ROSE 2024 Symposium](https://rose2024.ieee-ims.org/).
