# [liu2g.github.io](https://liu2g.github.io)

My personal portfolio website to provide professional info about myself,
as well as showcase projects I have worked or am working on.

The website pages are built with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) static page
generator.

In addition, the website uses the following plugins/extensions
- [Terminimal](https://github.com/pawroman/zola-theme-terminimal) theme
- [KaTex](https://katex.org/) LaTex rendering on the web
- [Nulltics](https://nullitics.com/) privacy focused analytics tool

## Directory Structure

The root of the repo is the root where Zola generate site from, and therefore
contains all the assets needed for the site. If you wish to explore the
workspace, refer to [Directory
structure](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/overview/) at Zola
docs.

Particularly, the `docs/` directory keeps the resulting webpages as seen at
the actual github.io page.
